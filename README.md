- Implements semantic search with vector databases (Pinecone)  
- Integrates Hugging Face embeddings for accurate understanding  
- Uses OpenAI language models for intelligent responses  
- Modular project structure for maintainability and scalability  
- Ready for deployment as a cloud-based service  

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- LangChain  
- Pinecone  
- Hugging Face  
- OpenAI API  
- Jupyter Notebook

## üîë API Keys Configuration

Before running the chatbot, you need to set your API keys in .env file:

```python
PINECONE_API_KEY = "<your_pinecone_api_key>"
